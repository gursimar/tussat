				Software: Terminal Program</div>
			<p>First of all: Forget about Hyperterminal! It just doesn't work. That's all I want to say about it and basically there isn't more to say. The terminal program used for debugging apps or as a user interface should be simple and it be able to show data in various formats, such as hex, binary or simple ascii. There's a few around that I can recommend:</p>
			<p><a href="http://bray.velenje.cx/avr/terminal/" target="_blank">Bray's AVR Terminal:</a></p>
			<p>Is a simple but powerful terminal. You can use almost any data length you might want (5 to 8 bits), speed, handshaking and all that in the main window. No searching around in &quot;options&quot;-menus! Decimal, Hex and binary display can be turned on in addition to the main data window which can be switched from ascii to HEX. Logging and macros are also implemented. Very good!</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.mpfreezone.com/FREE_TOOLS/free_tools.html" target="_blank">SuperTerm V2 and Super Simple Terminal:</a></p>
			<p>These are both available on the same page and also have proven to work well. SuperTerm V2 has a scripting/macro engine as well. Check them out! I haven't tested them thoroughly, but they are good.</p>
			<p>When setting up the terminal programs, the following general settings are suitabe for communicating with an AVR:</p>
			<p>Baud rate as required</p>
			<p>data length as required (usually 8 bits)</p>
			<p>no parity</p>
			<p>1 Stop bit</p>
			<p>no handshaking</p>
			<p>With a properly working cable everything should be fine!</p>
