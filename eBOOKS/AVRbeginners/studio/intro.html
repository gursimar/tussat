				The AVR Studio Pages</div>
			<p>In this section we'll write about using AVR Studio. The first page is &quot;Creating a New Project&quot;, and more are to come, especially about the simulator and the STK500 tools. New pages will be added as required. Explaining this software needs a lot of images which need to be placed well, but unfortunately webspace is limited, so sometimes we're limited to text in order to have more space available for more complicated things...</p>
