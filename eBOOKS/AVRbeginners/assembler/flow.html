			Flow Charts
		</div>

		<div class="content">
			<p>Flow charts are a graphical representation of code, Program states or even SRAM contents, if used in a creative way. Once you know 
			how to use them for code you'll quickly develop your own style to create flow charts for almost anything.

			<p>When you think about implementing a special algorithm or peripheral driver it might be better to have a flow chart already done 
			before you start hacking code. That will save lots of time. Trust me. I know. If you have code that is not sufficiently commented or 
			just BIG, analyse it by making up a flow chart. Very often that helps, especially when you got it from the web.</p>

			<p>Especially when writing code in assembler they are a great help, because assembler instructions are not always self-explanatory 
			and even well-structured code will get hard to read once it has grown to a certain size.</p>
			<p>Here is a small example flow chart:</p>
			<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" height="535">
				<tr height="535">
					<td style="border-width: 0px;" width="304" height="535" valign="top" align="left">
						<img src="img/flow.gif" alt="" height="538" width="297" border="0">
					</td>

					<td style="border-width: 0px;" height="535" valign="top">
						You can find a good program for editing flow charts at <a href="http://www.rff.com">www.rff.com</a>. But a 
						piece of paper will do the job too if you need to make up one.
