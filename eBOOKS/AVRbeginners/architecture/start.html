			<p>The AVR architecture is quite easy to understand. The pure page count of this section might frighten a total beginner, but most of them are quite easy to understand. If you know what you're looking for it's even simpler.</p>
			<p>For a start just browse through this and have a look at the examples. The examples can be found by opening the individual architecture folders. Most examples have been written for the mega8 or will be rewritten for it.</p>
			<p>NOTE: These descriptions are in no way complete! Some mega AVRs have much more features, and also some of the classic AVRs have different sets of peripherals - we can't replace all datasheets! Always have the datasheet open!</p>
