			<p>The SRAM contents can't be changed as easy as the register contents, but there are a few powerful instructions. You can either 
			use direct addresses (like 0x60 or a label which has been assigned to an address) or index registers to have indirect 
			addressing.</p>

			<p>Direct Addressing:</p>

			<p>lds and sts load from and store to a direct address.</p>

			<p>lds r16, 0x60 will load register 16 with the data stored at address 0x60 in SRAM.</p>

			<p>sts 0x60, r16 will store the register 16 data at SRAM address 0x60.</p>

			<p>Indirect Addressing:</p>

			<p>I'll first explain the AVR's index register pairs. The index register pairs are registers 26 to 31, with register pair 26:27 
			named X, 28:29 named Y and 30:31 named Z. These can be used as pointers to SRAM. The instructions for index registers not only 
			support loading/storing, but also act on the index register pair itself if needed.</p>

			<p>ld r16, X loads register 16 with data pointed at by X (r26:r27).</p>

			<p>ld r16, X+ loads register16 with data pointed at by X and also increments the register pair afterwards. This is 
			handy for processing strings or arrays of bytes. The index register pair will then point at the next address (the next character of 
			the string).</p>

			<p>ld r16, -X decrements the register pair before loading r16 with data pointed to by X. If the register pair pointed 
			at 0x61, r16 will have the value of address 0x60. X will point at 0x60 after the instruction is completed.</p>

			<p>Y and Z support these instruction as well, but have more features. Y and Z can be post-incremented by a constant value if needed 
			(does not work for pre-decrementing). If an array consists of 3-byte values, Y can be used to handle the first byte of consectutive 
			array elements in the following way:</p>

			<p>ldd r16, Y+3 If Y pointed at array[0].byte0, it will load that value to r16 and then point at array[1].byte0. Do not 
			try ld for this, it causes the assembler to give an error message (a good source for errors which is not easy to find 
			sometimes...)</p>

			<p>The Z register has even more features: It can be used to work with Flash contents.</p>

			<p>lpm loads register 0 with the Flash byte Z points at. As Flash is arranged (and addressed) in words (byte pairs) you 
			have to multiply constant addresses by 2 to get a byte address.</p>

			<div class="codebox">
				ldi ZL, low(2*label)<br>
				ldi ZH, high(2*label)<br>&nbsp;<br>
				label:<br>
				.db &quot;Hello world&quot;, 0<br>
				lpm
			</div>

			<p>If the address is not multiplied by two and label is at byte address 0x60 (word address 0x30), Z will point at the 
			code stored there. I hope this clarified the addressing problem. Other versions are</p>

			<div class="codebox">
				lpm r16, Z<br>
				lpm r16, Z+
			</div>

			<p>which work like ld and st, but in Flash. The ATmega series also supports spm (store 
			program memory). This is an advanced feature and not as easy to use as lpm.</p>

			<p>push and pop work on the Stack Pointer. The Stack points at SRAM as well and is also modified by 
			function call and return instrutions (for a description of the stack pointer (SP) see the AVR Archtecture section). 
			push stores a register on the stack and pop loads a value from the stack into a register. This feature is 
			usually used in ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) to preserve registers also used in normal code.</p>
