			I/O Instructions
		</div>

		<div class="content">
			<p>The simplest I/O instructions are in and out.</p>
			<p>in reads the value of an I/O Port or internal peripheral register (Timers, UART and so on) into a register.</p>
			<p>Example: in r16, PinD</p>
			<p>out writes the value of a register to an I/O Port or an internal peripheral register.</p>
			<p>Example: out PortD, r16</p>
			<p>If only one bit of an I/O register is needed, the AVR has some bit instructions: sbi and cbi for manipulating single bits of an I/O register (though these instructions don't operate on all I/O registers) and sbic and sbis for testing bits of an I/O register.</p>
			<p>sbi PortD, 7 (same for cbi)</p>

			<p>sbic PortD, 7<br>rjmp bit_is_set</p>

			<p>sbic/sbis (skip if bit in I/O register is cleared/set) skips the next instruction depending on the I/O bit's state. 
			In the example above I added a relative jump (rjmp) to show you how you could use this instruction. In this case, the 
			mcu will jump to bit_is_set if bit 7 of PortD is not cleared (-&gt;set) and proceed with the instruction following the relative jump 
			if that bit is cleared.</p>
			<p>As I mentioned above, sbi and cbi don't operate on all I/O registers. The same is true for sbic/sbis. These can only be used for &quot;classic&quot; I/O Ports and other peripheral registers with addresses from 0 to 31 (0x00 to 0x1F).</p>
