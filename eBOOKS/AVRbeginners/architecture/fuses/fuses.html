		<p>Certain features of AVRs are controlled by
fuse bits. For example, settings like clock options or the brown-out
reset circuit are configured with these bits. These configurations
differ from the other AVR peripherals (like SPI, ADC, etc) because you
set the fuse bits at program time (with a programmer) instead of
writing to some I/O memory space register at run time. So, for
instance, to set the AVR to use an external oscillator, you must set
this at the moment you program it. There is no way to change the clock
behavior through the program code. If you change your mind, you must
reprogram the AVR.<br>
</p><p>The details of how to program
the fuse bits in your AVR depend on the particular programmer you are
using. Consult the manual about the details. For instance, if you are
using an STK500 with AVR Studio, the STK500 window has a tab labeled
Fuses, where you set the different bits and where you can program,
verify or read the fuse bits.</p>
<p>A little oddity is
that to program a feature, you must write a "0" to the particular bit.
It's sort of a negative logic. If you are programming the fuse bits with AVR
studio, you don't have to worry about this issue because the value of
the fuse bit is managed by the programmer.</p>

<p>Fuse bits live in a different memory space than
the program memory. This means that the fuse bits are not affected by a
program memory erasure. This has the advantage that once you program
the correct fuse bits in your AVR, you can forget about them and don't
need to reprogram them each time you alter the program memory.</p>

<p>Fuse bits differ greatly between different AVR
variants. Some AVRs, like the AT90S8535, have only two fuse bits, while
others, like Atmega128, have 18. I will explain the AT90S4433's fuse
bits.</p>

<p>The AT90S4433 AVR has 6 fuse bits. One is related to serial programming (SPIEN), two are related to the Brown-Out Reset
Circuit operation (BODEN and BODLEVEL), and three are for configuring
the clock options (CKSEL2..0).</p>

<p>AVRs have two programming modes, parallel and serial. (See the
Memory Programming section of the datasheet for details). When the
SPIEN fuse bit is programmed, serial programming and data downloading
is enabled. The default value for this fuse is programmed. You can
change this fuse only if you are programming the AVR in parallel mode.</p>

<p>The Brown-Out Detector circuit monitors the Vcc
voltage. When Vcc drops below the trigger level, this
circuit resets the AVR. When Vcc is above the trigger level, the reset
signal is released. If you want to enable the Brown-Out Detector
circuit, you must program the BODEN fuse. The BODLEVEL fuse sets the trigger
level. The following table summarizes this:<br>

There are several options for the AVR clock which differ in the
start-up time after a reset. You need to adjust the start-up time
according to the clock source you are using. See the datasheet and
the clock section for more details. The following table summarizes the
setting of CKSEL fuses:<br>

Common Pitfall</div>

<p>A common pitfall with fuses is to forget about them, so you end up
working with the default settings. If you are lucky, these are the
settings you need, but if you are not, strange things will happen. For
instance, many AVRs have an internal oscillator, which is enabled by
default. If you are using the UART based on the frequency of an
external oscillator, your serial link won't work. Or maybe your
Atmega128 is not working as expected, because you forget to unprogram
the Atmega103 compatibility mode fuse, which is programmed by default.
So, here is my advice: Carefully check the fuse bits before using your
AVR!</p>
