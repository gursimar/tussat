Press [ F11 ]. The Temp variable is decremented (0xFF - 1 = 0xFE). In addition
the PINB register changes from 0x00 to 0xFF! Why? To find out why this happens
you have to look at the PORT sections of the datasheet. The explanation is that
the PORTB is first latched out onto the pin, then latched back to the PIN register
giving you a 1 clock cycle delay. As you can see, the simulator behaves like the
actual part! The next instruction is a relative jump back to the Loop label.
