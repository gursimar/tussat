Ferrari electronic GmbH provides standard software and hardware 
tools as well as customer specific solutions. 

For customer specific and OEM developments, we can offer you com-
plete turnkey systems, or work with you in all steps of product 
development, from the specification through hardware and software 
implementation. We provide consulting, CAD schematic design, CAD 
layout services, and small to medium volume manufacuturing on the 
hardware side, as well as consulting, design, and implementation 
of complete software systems or single modules. 

Although Ferrari electronic is a young company, all members of 
our team have years of experience in hardware and software deve-
lopment. Our main field of work is telecommunications, with cur-
rent developments ranging from Fax G3 and G4, through Modems and 
Teletex equipment, to ISDN solutions. We are also pursuing the 
growing SCSI market with our current FSC-series of host adapters, 
and with planned new SCSI based products. We can supply you with 
SCSI drivers, and SCSI designs, both for target and initiator 
applications.

   for FCB operations). All directory operations, volume labels, 
   FAT, BPB (including DOS 4.0 extended BPB), and DOS 4.0 
   compatible large partitions are supported. Block devices are 
   interfaced through DOS-compatible device drivers or simplified 
   device driver modules. Interface is through C function calls 
   for high speed operation. Implemented mainly in C, compatible 
   with Turbo C and Microsoft C. 

   Requires Turbo C 2.0 or later, or Microsoft C 5.1 or later, 
   plus MASM 5.1 or later, or TASM 1.0 or later. 

   Price: DM 450 (US$ 280) for binary only version (includes 
          sample device driver sources).

          DM 1200 (US$ 750) for full source code.

   computers (up to four cards per bus) and as stand-alone serial fax
   box. A 16-bit processor, 512k RAM, and FIFO bus interface for high
   speed data exchange minimize host processor loading, and allow
   minimal TSR size (approx. 30k) while supporting full background
   send and receive without disturbing foreground applications.
   G3 standard, 9600 bps with fallback to 7200, 4800, and 2400 bps.
   Also supports connection to Sotec ISDN-board for G3-fax over ISDN
   lines.

   Standard DOS software includes an easy to use send/receive
   interface, a Windows 3.0 printer driver to allow sending from any
   Windows application, plus a DOS printer driver emulating an Epson
   printer for compatibility to most DOS-based word processing and
   graphics software. In addition, all CAS-based software packages
   (PC-Tools 6.0, Fax-It for Windows, etc.) can be used with the
   supplied CAS driver.

   A low-cost toolkit for system developers is available.
   UNIX-based software will be available 1Q 1991.

   The card has passed postal certification for Germany. Other
   certifications will follow soon.
