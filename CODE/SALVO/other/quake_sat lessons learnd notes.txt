We chose a general purpose CPU:
• PRO: Ease of design; can support an operating system
• CON: Power hungry 2.5 W

Diamond Systems Prometheus CPU system included abuilt-in 16-channel, 16-bit A/D converter.

Linux OS fully compatible with Prometheus CPU board.

This meant that no time was wasted finding or developing I/O drivers.

Another advantage was that several key device drivers were already written for AX.25 (packet protocol) and the Baypac modem.

These include free utilities that report 
memory use
disk space utilization
software status
date/time manipulation.

The utilities were easily integrated into a set of diagnostic scripts that were used to report status to the contact software. 
Other useful utilities included
compression (bzip2)
data integrity checking (md5sum)
shell utilities like cat, grep,bash, etc.

IP protocol stack
PING, SSH, and SCP

DISADVANTAGES
the great flexibility requires much more testing (there can be a high number of corner cases)

there is limited time-tagging accuracy (although our chosen Diamond Systems Prometheus computer
addressed this with hardware timers).

require the support of many files that work together and must be present in a valid state. With such
a small team Quakefinder never had the time or developed the code necessary to validate all of the Linux files necessary to operate the payload software. It should be pointed out that Linux tools exist to solve this problem; one only needs time.
